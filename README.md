# React Hooks vs Class Components

The Product.js class component has 55 lines of code compared to 38 lines of code in the
Stock.js component using Hooks (useState). Both components achieve the same result
but there is a huge difference in the amount of code written.

The code on large projects becomes lighter and easy to work with, the total
percentage reduced is by 30.90% in the example given.
